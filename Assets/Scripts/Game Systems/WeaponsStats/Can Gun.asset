  description: There are different kind of animals that have became part of the daily
    life and more profundly, part of the family of more inteligent species that surrounds
    our planet. Seems like the owner of this gun enjoyed the company of a dog or
    simply like them a lot enough to   craft a powerful gun that honored  them. It
    takes one turn  after use to use again due the reloading. Some  times, after
    a successful  button press, the enemy could end up with decreased attack  for
    some turns.
