  description: "Along with the recipe, there is a note that says the following message: 
    \u201COne could say that the undetectable surprise is a good choice. Some other
    say that the key is having the skills or technique. I say a strong punch is another
    factor that should not be forgotten on the equation. If for some reason I get
    killed, use my weapon for good or I will hunt you down when you  are deep in
    your  sleep.\u201D Some  times, after a successful  button press, Amber  would
    have the  chance to put the enemy to sleep for  some  turns."
