  description: Sometimes one single hit could not make the job, hence why  with the
    proper tools and parts, this gun became a reality. Due the mechanism, it lacks
    effectivity on  a long distance, yet it is definetly deadly on a close encounter.
    It takes two turns  after use to use again due the reloading.  Some  times, after
    a successful  button press, the enemy could end with decreased defense for some
    turns.
