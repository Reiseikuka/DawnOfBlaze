  description: "One mind is good, two minds are more helpful, \xBFthree? \u2026now

    soul of the wielder enough to make them as dangerous as a draconian weapon. After
    a successful  button press, Darious  would have the chance to get the foe sleeping
    for some turns and increased damage for  him for some turns."
