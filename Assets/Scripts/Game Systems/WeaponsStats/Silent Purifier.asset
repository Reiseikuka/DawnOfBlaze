    the calmness of its beuty to one seeking rest. When twisted, one  could  burn 
    and another can blind. This is no ordinary Katana  since it was designed  by
    a monk who traveled  through the world seeking to cut down the evil that could
    saw through Finela. No one seem him go back home.  After a successful  button
    press, Erick  would have his damage increased for the next turn and the foe damage
    would be reduced for  some turns.
