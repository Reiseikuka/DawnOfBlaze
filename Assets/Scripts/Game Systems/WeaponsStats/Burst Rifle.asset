  description: Rifle with a mechanism that allows the user to fire a three-round
    burst per reload.  Considering the prototype notes, seems like the creator  wanted
    to create a weapon that could avoid the waste of ammunition and help with the
    performance and maybe, creating better rifles out of this prototype in the future.
    It takes one turn  after use to use again due the reloading. Some  times, after
    a successful  button press, the enemy could end up having decreased agility for
    some turns.
