  description: "Along with the recipe, there is a note that says the following message: 
    \u201CI have seen what is coming up from the darkness that is slowly forming
    through our lands. My strength wasn\u2019t enough to stand against some of these
    bastards but the Godess of Death has allowed me a final wish, which  was creating
    this weapon for  the one who defeats the creature who ended my life. I beg you,
    sabe this land from these darkness and make this fool proud.\u201D  After  a
    successful button press, Amber would steal health in regards of  a percentage
    of  the damage dealt to the enemy."
