  description: "Along with the recipe, there is a note that says the following message: 
    \u201CWho believe is in freedom when in reality you end up coming up being a
    slave of a single provocation? If you have the character to  use your will at
    the right moment, my mace will bring you the extra strength that you need dear
    wielder. \u201D Some  times, after a successful  button press, Amber  would have
    her damage increased for the next turn."
